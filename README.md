## Test useful bot

Useful bot is currently live and can be tested in action on the following discord server: [link to join server](https://discord.gg/Tb8A2XASWd).

```
# In order to show all available commands type:
!help
# Ps: Don't forget to include an ! before each command eg: !help, !roll_dice, !image ...

I plan to make the bot public in the future so that it can be hosted on other people's servers as well.

- Assigning roles and unassigning roles automatically to users depending on how they react to a welcome message. The bot also automatically creates a channel and posts a message in it if it doesn't already exist, and then seeds reactions depending on roles it is given.
